# work-day-scheduler-HW5

This project contains a html, javascript and css worksheet. 

// It consists of the live date and time, displayed at the top of the page. 
// The planner is organised such that it shows each timeblock with a text box that allows you to write a task/event. 
// When you click the save button, then the event for that time block is saved. 
// Each block is colour coded based on whether an event occurred in the past, present or future. 
// When you refresh the page, the saved events are shown.
